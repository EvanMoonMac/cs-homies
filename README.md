# hi cs homies

this is cs homies website. why? because uh we need cshomies.com
so i thought we would use this to host random stuff

## how to get started
ya its rlly ez:

1. clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/cttps/cs-homies.git`

2. CHECK THE REQUIREMENTS to get all teh stuff u need

3. with npm, download the dependencies by running `npm install`.

3. run `make docker-run` in a terminal.

4. *(optional)* run `make css` in a seperate terminal if u plan on using tailwind + daisy ui to edit any of ur pages. (just edit the template files )

boom ur done, now make a new branch or whatever and edit ur sites 

## requirements
1. Make sure u can run make commands from the Makefile. (Do `make test` to check). Probably Windows only issue, so download https://www.gnu.org/software/make/ or something if ur on win.

2. Get docker to run the container from https://www.docker.com/get-started/. (Do `docker -v` to check)

3. Ur gonna need npm, so u might have to download nodejs. https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager. (Do `npm -v` to check)

4. idk if there is anything that doesnt work lmk and i will update this


## 0aq (nobody has asked me any questions)
1. no u dont need golang cus its in a docker container
2. if u want endpoints opened to do stuff on the server, lmk or make the pull request urself if u can bother learning the language
3. no frontend framework yet
4. make sure docker is running before using it
